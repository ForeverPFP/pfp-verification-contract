## Why PFPVerification

A PFP verification list maintained by the community to avoid PFP image copycats.

Right now the PFP verification is done by opensea and twitter, but sometimes you may fooled by the verified PFP project with same image copy from bluechips with different background colors like [RRBAYC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ee6af0dff3a1ce3f7e3414c52c48fd50d73691e), unique PFPs collection list should be maintained by the community instead of centralized company like OpenSea providing service for twitter.

## Who can add/remove verification

A community voted group of people using multi-sig can add and remove verification, before the community vote, it's been managed by the project creators.
